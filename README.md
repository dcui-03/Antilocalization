# Doublet Recognition in Disordered Phononic Crystals with Mirror Symmetry
Research code for the anti-localization phononic crystal project. Additional information can be found in the README.txt.

To download code, click on the green "<> CODE" option. Go to the SSH tab and download as a .zip file.
You can also clone using the SSH key but this may require a GitHub account. Since the code will not be updated frequently, I recommend the .zip method.
